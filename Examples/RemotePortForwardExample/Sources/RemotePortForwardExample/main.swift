/// Example demonstrating remote port forwarding (reverse tunneling)
///
/// This example shows how to:
/// 1. Connect to an SSH server
/// 2. Request the server to listen on port 8080
/// 3. Forward incoming connections to a local HTTP server
///
/// To test this example:
/// 1. Start a local HTTP server: python3 -m http.server 3000
/// 2. Run this example with your SSH credentials
/// 3. The remote server will listen on port 8080
/// 4. Connections to remote_host:8080 will be forwarded to localhost:3000
